      <h1>Challenge</h1>
        <p>The challenge of this lab was to utilize jquery to create buttons that would then use toggle commands to interact with CSS elements.</p>
  </div>

  <div id = "problems">
      <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>One of the first problems we ran into was making the buttons swap out and toggle different CSS classes. This was mainly because the buttons had been created dynamically through jQuery and as a result, another method had to be used where the main div id had to be called in order for the toggle functions to work.</p>
  </div>

        <p>In the end we managed to make the site fully functional. Try it out!</p>
