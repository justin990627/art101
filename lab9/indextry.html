		<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenge for this lab was to utilize various javascript commands such as "getElementById" or "createElement" to interact with div ID's or to create various elements to manipulate.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>One of the problems faced was that the output was not being displayed correctly, which we later realized was due to not nesting the output div under the content div which formatted all of our text on top of our background video.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>In the end, we were able to correct any formatting issues, and were able to make our javascript display properly:</p>

		<div id = "output">
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="linkbox">
			<a class = "homelink" href = "../index.html"> &lt;&lt; Back Home</a>
			<a class = "sourcelink" href = "js/try.js" target = "source"> Javascript &gt;&gt; </a>
		</div>
