	<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>The challenge for this assigment was to create an array and an object with values transplanted from our previous lab </p>

	<div class="frame">
		<img src= "img/Mercedes.jpeg" width = "500" height = "400">
	</div>

	<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>One of the problems we encountered was our javascript not properly displaying. We tinkered around, until finally discovering that the reason was that we had incorrectly used "=" instead of ":" when declaring the data values in our object.</P>

	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>After getting used to javascripts syntax, we were able to have our javascript display correctly and have everything in working order.</p>

		<h2>Script Output</h2>
