		<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

			<form>
				<label for = "username"> Input your name:</label><br>
				<input type = "text" id = "username" name = "username"><br>
			</form>

			<button name = "my-button" type = "button">Click here!</button>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>For this lab we were tasked with using forms and buttons to accept user input and return a modified value using the div output id.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>One problem we faced is when we are coding in javascript, I forgot what we use for the label for username and the button. I accidentally use "my-username" and "button" in getElementById. Which is not what we wrote in .html file. So the code doesn't work for a bit. But after this problem is solved, everything works fine. </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here's the result of your new name: </p>
    	<div id = "output">
