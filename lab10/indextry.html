		<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>For this lab we were tasked with using forms and buttons to accept user input and return a modified value using the div output id.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>One problem we faced is when we are coding in javascript, I forgot what we use for the label for username and the button. I accidentally use "my-username" and "button" in getElementById. Which is not what we wrote in .html file. So the code doesn't work for a bit. But after this problem is solved, everything works fine. </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here's the result of your new name: </p>


				<input type = "text" id = "username"><br>
				<button id = "my-button">Submit</button>
    	<div id = "output"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
