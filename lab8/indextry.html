		<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge for this lab was to create an array and use functions to modify their values, as well as change the ways in which we called the functions.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Early on we encountered some dificulties, mostly because we were not assigning the modified array values to a new array, and so when we displayed them after calling the functions, they were still their unmodified original values.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Once that was dealt with, everything else went smoothly and our website was displaying the correct output in the console.</p>
		<p>Open Console to see the result</p>
		<div id="output">Check the Console.</div>
