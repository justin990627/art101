		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<h2>Lab Idea</h2>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file Structures on my computer and add index.html files</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The only problem I have is I don't really understand how to code in html. It is a language that I have to learn more about. But file structure isn't that hard to create since I have been sorting all my files into different folders and name each folders correctly so I can easily find them.</p>
		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p> This is lab3 index.html file that I create. Here is the file structure that I made.</p>

		<h2>Other Screenshots for Lab 3</h2>
		<p> First Task is to make sure I have everything in my ART 101 folders. That include lab1 ~ lab6.</p>

		<p>Second Task is to create an HTML file in the main art 101 folder and write a brief introduction of myself. And then create a bulleted lsit that link to each of the lab assignment. </p>

		<p>First part of Task 3 is to write about what I've already learned about HTML and include a screenshot from previous step</p>
