		<p>My name is Justin Juang and I love to play volleyball and video games in my spare time. Beside these two activities, I also like to take picture with my phone to make memories of where I have been to in the past.</p>

		<p>My name is Christian Decareau, I'm a transfer student from SF City College. I like to draw, paint, and play video games in my spare time. I'm new to the area so I've taken to going on hikes to explore, primarily the trails around Cabrillo College.</p>
