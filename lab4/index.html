	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>

		<div class="p1">
			<p>For this lab, the issue we were presented was to break down a complex task or goal into more manageable steps, and present that as code.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<div class="p1">
			<p>One of the easiest things to do when doing this assignment was to overcomplicate or overthink things. Whether it be everything that required getting an A in the class entailed or how each chess piece moves.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<div class="p1">
			<p> After process of elimination, and reigning in some of our overthought steps, we managed to create concise and organized psuedocode for our tasks.</p>


			<h3>Getting an A in a class</h3>
			<ol>
					<li>Preview before every lecture</li>
					<li>Participate in every lecture</li>
					<li>Review after every lecture</li>
					<li>Turn in assignments/projects on time</li>
					<li>Go to office hours</li>
					<li>Try to teach other students that are confused in your way of understanding</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Game of Chess</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Print the board</li>
				<li>Accept player role choice</li>
				<li>Initiate Player turn</li>
				<li>Test for "check" condition</li>
				<li>Accept Player input</li>
				<li>Test for "Checkmate" Condition</li>
			</ol>
