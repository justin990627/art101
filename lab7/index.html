		<h2> Challenge</h1>
		<p>The lab is pretty much straightforward. Just learning how to sort array into alphabetical order and convert string to array back and forth. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h1>
		<p>We originally wanted to use another video for the background but we don't know why that file doesn't work. So we change it to another video, and here's how it looks like.</p>
		<h2>Results</h1>
		<p>This is the index.html file I created. </p>
